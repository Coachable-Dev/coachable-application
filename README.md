# Coachable First Assignment
As a part of your trial period, we’d like to give you a sense of the Coachable process.

If you’re seeing this repository, you should have received a congratulatory conditional acceptance invitation. In this email you will find a Slack Channel, this is dedicated to answering your questions about the sorting assignment we’ve provided. We recommend completing this assignment within 2 weeks of joining Coachble.  

If you're having trouble making progress on the assignment, let us know by asking us in Slack - that's what we're here for. We've found the students that have been most successful in Coachable are the ones that  proactive and reach out to the coaches for help whenever they get stuck. We recommend you do this too.

## Helpful Resources
We've provided a short exercise based on sorting algorithms where you will identify various arrays at intermediate steps in the sorting process. We've provided several resources to help with this exercise and linked them below.

1. [Algorithms and Runtimes](/1_algorithms_runtime)
2. [Selection Sort and Insertion Sort](/2_elementary_sorts)
3. [Mergesort](/3_mergesort/)
4. [Heaps and Priority Queues](/4_priority_queues/)
5. [Quicksort](/5_quicksort/)

Studying these 5 sections should cover enough material to complete the exercise below. If you're still stuck after studying these for a while, feel free to use any additional resources online to study the assignment. There are practice exercises at the end of each section that we encourage you to try as these exercises prepare you well for the sorting exercise below. However, these exercises are not required.
