# Coachable First Assignment
As a part of your trial period, we’d like to give you a sense of the Coachable process.

If you’re seeing this repository, you should have received a congratulatory conditional acceptance invitation. In this email you will find a Slack Channel, this is dedicated to answering your questions about the sorting assignment we’ve provided.

Asking questions in the Slack Channel, while not required, will help us pair you with a great coach that matches your learning style. Additionally, this is an indicator that helps us learn more about how proactive you are and will assist you in understanding the concepts more quickly.

## Helpful Resources
We've provided a short exercise based on sorting algorithms where you will identify various arrays at intermediate steps in the sorting process. We've provided several resources to help with this exercise and linked them below.

1. [Algorithms and Runtimes](/1_algorithms_runtime)
2. [Selection Sort and Insertion Sort](/2_elementary_sorts)
3. [Mergesort](/3_mergesort/)
4. [Heaps and Priority Queues](/4_priority_queues/)
5. [Quicksort](/5_quicksort/)

Studying these 5 sections should cover enough material to complete the exercise below. If you're still stuck after studying these for a while, feel free to use any additional resources online to study the assignment. There are practice exercises at the end of each section that we encourage you to try as these exercises prepare you well for the sorting exercise below. However, these exercises are not required.
